## 2. Clarification on Repository Contents & Binary Distribution

### Source Code and Declarative Recipes Only
This repository distributes **only original source code, utility scripts, configuration templates, and declarative YAML cartridge recipes** created under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

### No Redistribution of Proprietary or Third-Party Binaries
- **No Third-Party Binaries Hosted:** This repository does **NOT** host, store, package, or redistribute proprietary binaries, third-party compiled packages, or copyrighted media blobs.
- **Local Client-Side Fetching:** When a user executes the Cartilage OS build scripts (such as `cartilage build` or `build_cartridge.sh`), the tool downloads official packages directly from official, public, upstream package distribution mirrors (such as official Arch Linux or Alpine Linux repositories) directly to the user's local machine.
- **Independent Licensing at Build Time:** All downloaded packages, shared libraries, and toolchain components remain governed exclusively by their respective upstream authors and licenses. Users are responsible for verifying that their local builds and cartridge images comply with the respective upstream software licenses.

## 5. End-User Responsibility & Hardware Flashing Warning

### Risk of Data Overwrite
Cartilage OS includes disk flashing and partitioning utilities (e.g., `cartilage flash`, `scripts/13_flash_usb.sh`) that write disk structures directly to raw block devices (`/dev/sdX`, `/dev/nvmeXn1`). 

- **End-User Responsibility:** Flashing a disk image is an inherently destructive operation. Selecting the wrong target drive **WILL IRREVOCABLY DESTROY EXISTING OPERATING SYSTEMS AND USER DATA**. 
- **Verification Requirement:** Users are solely and strictly responsible for verifying the target block device identifier prior to executing any write or format operation.
- **Legal Compliance:** Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of flashed USB media complies with all applicable institutional policies, local laws, and regulations.
